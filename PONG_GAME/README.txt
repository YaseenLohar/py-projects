## 🎮 How to Play

### Option 1: Run from Source (requires Python)
1. Download all files: `main.py`, `ball.py`, `paddle.py`, `scoreboard.py`
2. Place them in the same folder
3. Run `main.py`
4. Make sure Python is installed (comes with `turtle` on most versions)

### Option 2: Run on Windows (no Python needed)
- Download the `.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/releases) section
- **Note:** You may need to **temporarily disable antivirus** — there's **no virus**, it's just flagged because it's packaged using PyInstaller
