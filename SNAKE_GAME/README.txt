# 🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle Version)

A basic **Snake Game** implementation using **Python** and **Turtle graphics**, built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the arrow keys:
  - `Up` → Move Up  
  - `Down` → Move Down  
  - `Left` → Move Left  
  - `Right` → Move Right

- Eat the food to grow longer 🟢
- Avoid crashing into the walls or yourself — that ends the game ❌

## 🚀 Features

- Classic Snake mechanics
- Food appears in random positions
- Snake grows on eating food
- Game over detection when:
  - Snake hits a wall
  - Snake collides with itself
- Clean and modular OOP design

## 🧠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries needed — only uses built-in `turtle` and `time` modules
